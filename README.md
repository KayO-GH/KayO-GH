      <li>⌛ Over the last 5 years I have focused on Data Science and Machine Learning, building on a foundation of 9 years of experience in Software Engineering. <br/>
        I have worked, <i>and played</i>, with programming stacks and technologies from microcontrollers through mobile and web app development to cloud systems.</li>
      <li>💞 <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/KayO/WebsiteImageSafetyAnalyzer">This</a> is my latest pet project. It's a POC for an AI tool to protect kids online and make sure they don't stumble across unwholesome content. It uses Computer Vision to assess website safety for kids (More CV cases and additional NLP work will follow soon).<br/>
      I’m looking to collaborate on projects geared towards making the internet safer for kids. ☺️</li>
