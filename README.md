    I've been running two blogs for a few years now:
    <ul>
      <li>👀 I’m an engineer with an interest in AI & Software</li>
      <li>🌱 I’m currently diving deeper into the <a href="https://www.fast.ai/">FastAI</a> and <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a> libraries</li>
      <li>💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects geared towards making the internet safer. Especially for kids. I started work on <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/KayO/WebsiteImageSafetyAnalyzer">this project</a> not too long ago to use Computer Vision to assess website safety for kids (More CV cases and additional NLP work will follow soon).<br/>
      It's a work in progress towards an AI tool to protect kids online and make sure they don't stumble across unwholesome content.</li>
      <li>📫 You can reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kwadwo-agyapon-ntra/)</li>
